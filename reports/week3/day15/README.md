# Day 15: Finishing the *Availabilities* and implementing the *Assignments* UI

The plan for today was to finish the *Availabilities* implementation and then implement the *Assignments* UI.

## Conclusions

Today was pretty uneventful, finishing the UI was straightforward given the experience I had from previous days. Cursor was a great help as usual.
