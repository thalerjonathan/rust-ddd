# Day 15: Finishing the *Availabilities* and implementing the *Assignments* UI

The plan for today was to finish the *Availabilities* implementation and then implement the *Assignments* UI.

## Results

I did a lot of refactorings and added also the functionality to remove an already committed referee.

## Conclusions

Today was pretty uneventful, finishing the UI was straightforward given the experience I had from previous days. Cursor was a great help as usual. 

I have decided to stop work on the monolith and leave it in the state as it is, and will write a reflection on the work so far, and then start with the work on the microservice approach.
