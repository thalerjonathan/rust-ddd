# Day 3: Bootstrapping the UI with Leptos

On Day 3 the plan was to bootstrap the UI with Leptos. What I wanted to arrive at was a basic UI for the Referee endpoints, that is, create a new Referee, list details of a single Referee and list all existing Referees.

## Results

I started off with telling Cursor to "implement the leptos UI for the Referee endpoints". It came up with a some basic leptos code, but it was too generic and not tailored to the specific requirements of the Referee endpoints - I wanted to see if Cursor could generate the code for the specific UI components for the Referee endpoints.

## Conclusion
