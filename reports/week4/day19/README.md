# Day 19: Adding Caching via Redis

Due to time limitations I was not able to implement the caching via Redis on Day 18, therefore the plan for today was to do that.

If time permits I will also add Kafka to emit Domain Events that can be used to invalidate the cache, e.g. in case the club of a Referee has changed.
